This folder contains 5 different YML applications :
-LU factorization (blockLU.query)
-LU factorization used to solve a linear system (blockLUsolveLS.query)
-Gaussian ellimination used to solve a linear system (blockGauss.query)
-Gauss Jordan used to solve a linear system (blockGaussJordan.query)
-Gauss Jordan used to invert a matrix (gaussJordan_inv.query)

It contains also the same applications implemented with components that save the initial matrices and/or vectors and the final ones. It allows debug and verification of the results.

To compile them use
./compile name
where name corresponds at name.query

The folder test_components contains  test applications for each component. To compile them you will have to use the ./compileXXXX file associated to the component. It also redeploy the implementation component by using ./impl_SIZE/deploy (see impl/README for more informations) then recompile the tested component.
